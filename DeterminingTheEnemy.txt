One of the main strategic decisions within Stratego is whether to attack
or not. This decision is keyed off of two main important factors: first,
whether or not you are sure that you are stronger then the opponent, and 
second, whether the information to be gained is worth the risk of facing
an unknown enemy piece. We will be using Bayesian inference/probability
to attempt to determine the given identity of an unknown enemy piece. We
should be able to utilize different observed behaviors and movements of 
the enemy to establish a probabilistic level of certainty across a range of
possible enemy units. For instance, if an enemy at a given position has
never moved, and the game is sufficiently advance, it is highly probable
that the unit is either a bomb or the flag. These sorts of deductions and 
more will be explored by our implementation.
