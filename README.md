Areas of the Game for Algorithms:

1. Initial Board Layout (Purvik)
	- Genetic Algorithm
	- Steepest Hill / Gradient Descent
	- Random

2. Movement/Attacking (Mansi)
	- Depth First
	- Bread First
	- A*
	- Backtracking

3. Inference of Enemy at Given Position (Alex)
	- Bayes Probability of who's at the square

4. Strategy (Vikram)
	- Utility Score based on heuristic
	- MinMax??

5. Endgame / Scenarios
	- Small set of problems with discoverable 'obvious' actions
	- i.e. Red has only the flag left and it should be attacked

6. Machine Learning?? (Whoever has the time :) )
	- Datasets??
