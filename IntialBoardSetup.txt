The first thing a player needs to do whenever a new game is of stratego begins is to arrange
his 40 pieces on his side of the board. Unlike traditional games like chess, stratego does 
not have any fixed starting positions for all the individual pieces. Each player has to start 
with their setup and these starting setups define the fundamental strategy a player is going 
within that game. Coming up with good starting board positions is important for winning the game.
We will use the genetic algorithm and steepest hill algorithm to come up with a good starting board
position for the AI agent. Starting position does not win us the game but helps us start the game 
strongly. there can be many good starting positions so there won't be a proper goal state 
but we will try to implement it to start with a random state and improve it in a fixed amount of 
iterations using GA or steepest hill and start the game with that state. To determine if one state 
is better than the other we will have to check if our flag is protected well, all the other pieces
are arranged in a way where we have a good defence against the enemy team and we also have good attacking
pieces in our front row to initiate our offence. Based on the setup reached by the algorithm, we will 
also figure out what strategy we should use to start the game, aggressive or defensive?
